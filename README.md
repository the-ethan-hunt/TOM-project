# TOM-project
 This is a subject project undertaken as an Active Learning Assignment(ALA) in autumn semester of 2017-18 for the course Theory of Machines guided by Prof. Nitinchandra Patel.
 
### About the code
The project is composed of three different sections that apply the basic principle of the use of flywheel in punching press.
- [Mass Calculation](#mass-calculation)
- [Stress analysis](#stress-analysis)
- [Material analysis](#material-analysis)

## Mass Calculation
The mass of flywheel is calculated in kgs for a punching press or riveting operation given its other parameters and assuming zero frictional losses.

## Stress Analysis
The shear and compressive stresses required in punching a hole in a sheet were calculated for some commonly-used materials.

## Material Analysis
The mass of flywheel required for punching each material were calculated keeping power rating constant and assuming 15 per cent frictional losses.

### License
The project holds MIT license.
